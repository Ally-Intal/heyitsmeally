<p>I am a college student now, I must say that I am putting a lot of pressure in myself right now. It's hard to comply sometimes, owing to the fact that we don't have an internet connection. I will not give up on my dreams. Even if it's hard, I know this will be worth it. I met a lot of friends online which are my classmate, I am excited to meet all of them. </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
