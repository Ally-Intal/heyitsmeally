<p>I wanted to be an educator someday, but I will still pursue this IT career. I wanted to become an educator owing to the fact that I believed in "Curing ignorance is the key in all of successions" I always wanted to become successful because of my parents. I want to give back to them, for all their sacrifices to me and to my siblings. I am very grateful for all of my friends, family, and for the people who keeps inspiring me. I want be succesful someday so that I can bring with me the people who are behind of my accomplishments. They are the reason why I always wanted to be productive in my everyday life. My niece Nash Jadiel is one of the reason why I'm always sane. I love her with all my heart!! See photos attached to see my inspirations in life.  </p>

I know you'll be back soon,<br>
