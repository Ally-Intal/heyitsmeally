<p> I can say that my toddler years was amazing and I sure do a lot of fun back then. When I turn into 1 year old. I celebrated it on my grandma's house. There was a lot of people, relatives, friends and even our neighbors was there. Not that I can remember all of it, I saw it on our album. I celebrated my 2nd birthday at the resort. My family and I went on outing, we were so happy back then and now itâ€™s all just a memory now. I remember when I was three years old, my mom brought me to a parent meeting with her. I sat beside her and I got bored at their meeting, I looked around I saw the statue of Lakandula and I got mesmerized by it. I stood up and went for it. I didn't even realize that there was a fence, I got my head stucked at the fence. I felt so embarrassed that time because a lot of people was looking at me.
