<p>After I graduated elementary, I started my new journey at Lakandula Highschool. On my 7th grade i am not focused on my studies. I am just a teen who wants to enjoy her teenage days. To cut the long story short, when I became a sophomore, that when I started focusing on my studies. I became at the top my class. I remember when I was at grade 9. I met a new set of friend that I can call my closest friends. Grade nine days was and always will be the greatest memory in my highschool life. This is also the saddest part of my Highschool life, because of my friend who passed away. When he left us, he also left all the good and happy memories with us. God know how much we miss him. On my 10th grade, I became a lot responsible. I handle my whole section well and being an officer in a school baranggayette that handles a every grade 10 student is one of a hell job. Being all of that busy, I completed my highschool years being an honor student. </p>
